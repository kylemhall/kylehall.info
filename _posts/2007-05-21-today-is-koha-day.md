Hello All,

The Meadville Public Library has finally switched over to Koha! For those who don&#8217;t know, I work for the [Crawford County Federated Library System](http://meadvillelibrary.org) as an IT Technician. My primary job for the past year and a half has been to work on the Open Source ILS [Koha](http://koha.org) so that it would meet our needs as a replacement ILS. I created a new Librarian Interface, add a Clubs and Services module, added a Rotating Collections module, and submitted many bug fixes and small features. I also created a side-project called Koha-Tools that houses many useful additions that didn&#8217;t belong as part of Koha itself, such as a replacement fines generator, a set of fancy reports, a Firefox extension, and many other things.

The CCFLS also paid the company [Liblime](http://liblime.com) to ingrate the Zebra indexing engine into Koha, thus speeding it up well over one-hundred fold. Liblime and the rest of the Koha team gave us tons of help getting up and running. I have to admit that when I first looked at the source code for Koha, I was intimidated, but now I know the system inside and out.

I&#8217;ve never seen a more shining example of Open Source Software at work. We give, and others benefit. Others give and we benefit. It&#8217;s a great system.
