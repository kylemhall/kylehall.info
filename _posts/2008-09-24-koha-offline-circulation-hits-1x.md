I believe the Koha Offline Circulation client has hit a milestone. Geauga County is now using the KOC program on their bookmobiles to avoid resorting to pen-and-paper. Thanks to them, KOC has a much expanded feature set, a Koha community endorsed file format, and the server-side scripts are included as part of the Koha 3.x distribution.
