I&#8217;m still making alot of updates to Libki lately, the newest feature is a &#8216;Clients&#8217; view. On the Clients page of the web administration, you can see all the machines running the Libki client, and whether or not someone is logged into the client. I imagine this will be far more useful than limiting the User&#8217;s view to only logged in users.

I will be rolling this version out in production at the Linesville Public Library, most likely tomorrow.

In addition, a reservations system will be coming soon. It is in the planning stages. If anyone has any suggestions for features, don&#8217;t hesitate to let me know!
