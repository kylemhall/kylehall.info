Hey All,

I&#8217;ve decided to avoid the messy business of setting up my own Koha git repository ( at least for now ). Instead, I&#8217;ve set up a Github account <a href="http://github.com/kylemhall/" target="_blank">here</a>.Â  I&#8217;ve configured github to update my twitter account ( <a href="http://twitter.com/kylemhall" target="_blank">kylemhall </a>) each time I make a push, so if you want to track my changes you can watch that. I may even set up automatic posting to this blog. I will be continuously rebasing from git.koha.org and pushing those updates so it will be up to date with the latest changes from the official git repository.

Kyle
