I&#8217;ve been working on a compete rewrite of Libki to improve it&#8217;s performance, aesthetics, and ease of installation. The client will be written in C++/Qt4, which gives it a nice look that can also be skinned to look native to any given OS. I&#8217;m still contemplating the possibilities for the web-based administration interface. I hope to make it fully AJAX. I hope to take advantage of [Web Sockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Sockets) if I can. Development has been put on short term hold while we roll out our Koha update, but expect to see more on this soon!
