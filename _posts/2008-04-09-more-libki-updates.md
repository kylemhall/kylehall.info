I just completed the work necessary to run the LibKi client on Windows! The instructions are [here](http://kylehall.info/index.php/projects/libki-kiosk-system/). We are already running the LibKi kiosk software on about 10 Ubuntu thin clients, with around 50 to 75 unique user&#8217;s logging in each day.

The system has worked very well, the few issues we have are connected to the fact that I have customized our particular LibKi installation to integrate with the Koha ILS. By doing this, we are able to have a single username and password for each patron, for both Koha and LibKi. Those issues have been resolved, and we have not had any problems since.
