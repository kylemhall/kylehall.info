Libki is an integrated multi-platform kiosk management system. Libki is ideally suited for use in locations where a controlled computing environment is paramount such as public access systems, libraries, school computer laboratories and more!

The project now has it&#8217;s own dedicated site at <a href="http://libki.org" target="_blank">Libki.org</a>

The administration system is web-based for easy use from any operating system, install once and use it anywhere on your network. The client runs on any operating system that has Gtk2 support, including Linux, *BSD, and Microsoft Windows.
