# What is Koha?

[Koha](http://koha-community.org) is a full-featured open-source ILS. Developed initially in New Zealand by Katipo Communications Ltd and first deployed in January of 2000 for Horowhenua Library Trust, it is currently maintained by a team of software providers and library technology staff from around the globe.

I have been a Koha developer since 2005, when I became a full time employee of the Crawford County Federated Library System, and the Meadville Public Library. Since that time, I have contributed a number of features and bug fixes to the project, as well as creating the Koha Offline Circulation utility, and creating the Koha Virtual Appliance.

### Koha Offline Circulation
The [Koha Offline Circulation](/projects/koha/koha-offline-circulation.html) desktop application is the most fully featured way to handle offline circulation with Koha.
