# Libki

Libki is an integrated multi-platform kiosk management system. Libki is ideally suited for use in locations where a controlled computing environment is paramount such as public access systems, libraries, school computer laboratories and more!

The project has it's own dedicated site at <a href="http://libki.org" target="_blank">Libki.org</a>

The administration system is web-based for easy use from any operating system, install once and use it anywhere on your network. 

The Libki client is cross platform and is currently used on production on Windows and Linux operating systems, though it can theoretically be used on any platform supported by Qt5, the toolkit used to create it.
