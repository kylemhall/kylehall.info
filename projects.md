These days I&#8217;m working on a number of Open Source projects:

  * [Kuote](/index.php/projects/kuote/ "Kuote") 
      * Kuote is a personal project, meant to be a simple eLearning system.
  * [Koha](/index.php/projects/koha/ "Koha") 
      * Koha is an Integrated Library System written in Perl and released under the GPL.
  * [Koha-Tools](/index.php/projects/koha-tools/ "Koha-Tools") 
      * Koha-Tools is a side-project I&#8217;ve created to house the random assortment of programs and scripts that I&#8217;ve created while working on Koha that really don&#8217;t belong as part of the main Koha distribution.
  * [WordPress Plugins](/index.php/projects/wordpress-plugins/ "WordPress Plugins") 
      * I&#8217;ve written a few WordPress plugins to accomplish a few tasks.
